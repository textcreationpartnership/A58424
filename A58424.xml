            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE RELATION Of an Assault made by French Papists, UPON A <hi>Minister of the French Church.</hi>

            <p>ABout five Weeks agoe, the Wife of <hi>Monsieur de la Coste</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, dwelling then at the upper end of <hi>Bow-Street</hi> in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> lying upon her Death-Bed, sent for Mr. <hi>Du-Marest</hi> that he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and pray with her before she departed; which the aforesaid Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster having accordingly done, and acquitted himself of the Functions of his Ministry, the Sick Person caused the Company to be desired to withdraw, for that she had something in particular to say to her Husband and the Minister; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany being withdrawn, she desired her Husband to take care of a Daughter she had by a former Marriage, who lived in the House of the Widdow of one <hi>Reinbean,</hi> because that she was a Papist, and that she feared that after her Death she would Seduce her Daughter. The Husband promised to do what his Wife desired; the dying Person not content with the promise of her Husband, made the same request to the Minister, who assured her that he would acquit himself of his Duty, in that respect: The Sick Party dyed the day after, and the Father-in-Law sent immediately for the young Maid, Cloathed her very handsomely, and told her the last Will of her Mother; the young Maid made answer that she was born a Protestant, brought up as such, and that she should be very glad to be instructed in her Religion, that she might resist and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent falling into Errour. Her Father-in-Law finding her in that resolution, told her that it was requisite she should live in his House, to which she consented with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Heart. Some days after Widdow <hi>Reinbeau</hi> caused Mr. <hi>La Coste</hi> to be fetcht be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Justice</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> for detaining from her her Apprentice: He appeared there accordingly, and said that his Wifes Daughter was not an Apprentice, and that though she were so, he was not willing that she should be seduced, that he knew there was such a design; but the Justice without having regard to this, redelivered the young Maid into her pretended Mistresses hands. The Father-in-Law complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereof to his Friends, and while they were contriving to remedy this business, the young Maid went to Mr. <hi>Jehu</hi> a Gold-Smith dwelling in the House of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, and weeping bitterly, desired him to use the means of having her instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her Religion, and of getting her out of the Hands of the Papists. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to use his endeavours for that purpose, and that he might perform his word, he went to Mr. <hi>Dumarest</hi> a Minister, and told him the business; who assured him of Contributing all that lay in his power to his Efforts; and they two together agreed, that on <hi>Sunday</hi> the Second of <hi>June,</hi> the young Maid should go to the <hi>Greek.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99096:2"/>Church, and that she should be there examined. Accordingly she went thither to that intent, but the Minister being hastened to go to the <hi>Savoy</hi> Church, bid the young Maid follow him, that he would discourse her on the way, and that he would after that present her to the Consistory; which the young Maid agreeing to, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Minister, but they were no sooner in <hi>Newport-Street,</hi> than that Widdow <hi>Reinbeau,</hi> a Niece of hers, three of her Nephews, a Vintner, and other Papists, stopped the Maid and Minister in the way; and the Widdow with an insolent tone asked the Minister why he talked to that Maid? The Minister asked her by what authority she asked him that Question? To which she said that this Maid was her Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: The Minister told her that he was assured of the contrary, but that though she were so, he had a right to instruct her, and that it was only with that intent that he spoke to her, and that she followed him, that it was <hi>Sunday,</hi> and that after she had been Catechized, she should return unto her House, until it was known if she was under any obligation to her or not: Which after he had said, he bid the young Maid continue her way with him. The Widdow seeing that the young Maid followed, seized her with violence, swore that she should not go with the Minister, at the same time three of her Bullies surrounded the Minister, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had told them that he was amazed they should commit such a violence in the Kings High-way on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> when the business was only the instruction of one of his Subjects, being in fear of the <hi>Roman</hi> Dagger, he went to a Justice of Peace called Sir <hi>John Reresby,</hi> to inform him of the whole matter; the Minister was no sooner gone than that Mr. <hi>Jehu</hi> being desirous to get near the young Maid and speak to the Widdow <hi>Reinbeau,</hi> this Woman without hearing him, fell upon him, tore his Perruke and Shoulder knot off, and she and her Myrmaidons began to cry out a <hi>French Papist.</hi> This piece of Malice had like to have cost the Protestant his life: For at the same time some of the <hi>Mobile</hi> who were crouded about them seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by the Throat; but the Populace being undeceived, and having understood the <hi>Popish</hi> trick let go the Protestant, which the Papists perceiving, they ran into a House hard by, swearing they would cause the <hi>French</hi> Protestant to be stabbed. After they were got into that House, they immediately contrived how to secure their Prey, for that purpose they sent for a Chair, and had her conveyed away. During that Interval Mr. <hi>Du-Marest</hi> the Minister having discoursed Sir <hi>John Reres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> upon this business, this worthy Justice of the Peace, sent for a Constable, and gave him a Warrant, the Constable performed his Commission, brought the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and her Niece, but the other Papist prevented his seizing them by making their escape in the Crowd. The Justice of the Peace examined them concerning the Maid, they confessed that she was not an Apprentice, but a Maid they set to work, and to whom they gave twenty Shillings a year; upon this, and the Declaration which the young Maid made, he discharged her, and recommended the care of her to the Minister, and then proceeded to examine to the bottom the violent action which the Women had committed, and upon their Confession, and the Depositions of several Witnesses, he bound them to the Sessions. This conduct of the Papists would something startle me, if I did not daily hear of such-like Violences. But when I am assured that a certain papist called <hi>Maistre Jacques</hi> upon a dispute of Religion did so wound a Protestant that he is since dead of it: VVhen people of Honour assure me, that they hear Papists call the Illustrious Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> a VVhore, and beat those who oppose them upon this Subject; when I hear that the Papists threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned some years since, that they would set the Streets a flowing with Blood, when that I see people that are perverted every day, and who are taken from us by force, when I see that the Papists contemn the Kings Proclamations, that instead of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing according to his Pleasure to some distance from <hi>London,</hi> they crowd to that degree this City and its Suburbs, that one would say they Designed to make a Garrison of it; I do not wonder at this last insolence, and I apprehend much greater if care be not taken.</p>
